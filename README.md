#### Method
Skills
- NBA team and champion history information are scrapped from wikipedia using BeautifulSoup
- Scrapped data is cleaned with regular expression and pandas
- sql(pandasql) and pandas were used to answer most of the questions

Data sources
- [List of NBA champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions)
- [Current NBA teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#Teams)
